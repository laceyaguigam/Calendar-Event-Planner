# Calendar Event Planner
 
When planning for vacations or weekend getaways people often plan trips without looking at a calendar for upcoming holidays. Holidays can have a major impact on many aspects of plannig a trip such as cost, availability, and the amount of people at said location. 

We created a web application that allows users to search for upcoming holidays. The user is able to sort through various holidays using the calendar, allowing them to plan their trip accordingly.
 
As a travel enthusiast
I want to see upcoming holidays
So that I can plan trips accordingly.
 
## Installation 

Clone the Holiday Calendar source code located in the Github repository and save it to desired location on your device. The cloned folder can be used in VS Code or you preferred coding software. 
## Usage
 
Open the index.html file located within the cloned Holiday Calendar folder in preferred browser. 
Once the application is displayed on the browser, the user can then search for a month using the corresponding number (ex. January = 1, February = 2, etc.) to search for upcoming holidays and plan your trip accordingly.
